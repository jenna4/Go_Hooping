// In some assignments, you will be provided with a bit of "skeleton code"
// to get you started. However, this assignment is largely geared toward
// getting you up to speed on the basics of C++ programming, so there's very
// minimal starter code here for you.

// All of your programming assignments' driver files (i.e., the .cpp file
// containing the main() function) should have a program header at the
// top. Fill in the program header below:

/*
 * Author: <INSERT YOUR NAME HERE>
 * Program description: <VERY BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM HERE>
 */

// Recall: this is the syntax for importing / including system-installed
// header files in C++. The <iostream> header file gives you access to
// input / output (I/O) tools, like std::cout, std::cin, and std::endl, so
// that your program can interface with the terminal
#include <iostream>

// You'll also need <cstdlib> and <ctime> to use srand() and rand() for
// pseudorandom number generation (PRNG)
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

// TODO: Create many other functions here (you'll want several of them to
// satisfy the course's style guidelines: 
// https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~songyip/Teaching/CS16X/cpp_style_guideline.pdf)

// Recall: This is the main() function. It's the entrypoint to your program
// (i.e., it is where your program will both start and end).
int main() {
	// This line seeds your PRNG. You don't need to call srand() anywhere else.
	// After it's been called, you can then proceed to use the rand() function
	// to generate pseudorandom numbers at any point in your program.
	srand(time(nullptr));

	// TODO: complete the main function, having it call other functions (and
	// perhaps having those functions call other functions, and so on) to
	// complete the program as described in the assignment description document
	// on Canvas.
}
